Using for...in, iterate through the spaceship.crew object in 
the code editor and console.log() a list of crew roles and names in the following format: 
'[crew member's role]: [crew member's name]', e.g.,'chief officer: Dan'. 

for (let crewRole in spaceship.crew) {
    console.log (spaceship.crew.crewRole + ':' spaceship.crew.crewRole.name)
}
